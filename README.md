# Python Basics – Day 2  
## Conditions & Logical Thinking
## 📚 Topics Covered
- `if` statement  
- `if–else`
- `if–elif–else`
- Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

---

## 🧪 Practice Programs
- Check whether a number is **positive, negative, or zero**
- **Even or odd** checker
- Find the **largest of three numbers**
- Simple **grading system** using conditions

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Able to choose correctly between `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Can explain logical operators in plain English
- Can solve small decision-based problems independently

---

## 📝 Notes
- Logic written before coding
- No copy–paste used
- Focus on clarity, not shortcuts
