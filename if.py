#if statement is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
#In this example, the condition (a>40) is true, so the code inside the if block is executed, and "a is greater than 40" is printed to the console.
#If the condition were false (for example, if a were 35), the code inside the if block would not be executed, and nothing would be printed.
