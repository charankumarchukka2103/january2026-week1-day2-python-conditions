#This program checks whether the input number is positive, negative, or zero using if, elif statements.
#The first condition checks if the number is greater than 0. If true, it prints "the number is positive".
#If the first condition is false, it checks the second condition to see if the number is less than 0. If true, it prints "the number is negative".
#If both previous conditions are false, it checks the third condition to see if the number is equal to 0. If true, it prints "the number is Zero".
